   // 1. Write a console app that calculates a user's Body-Mass Index:
   //   - prompt the user for her height in metres and weight in kg
   //   - calculate the BMI as weight/height^2
   //   - output a message: underweight(bmi<18.5), overweight(bmi>=25) or healthy weight
   // 2. Structure your code so that structure it so that pure and impure parts are separate
   // 3. Unit test the pure parts
   // 4. Unit test the impure parts using the HOF-based approach
